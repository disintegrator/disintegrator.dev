A little while ago the [Explicit Resource Management proposal][erm-proposal] was
promoted to stage 3 and with it the introduction of the `using` keyword. Support
for this feature was then introduced into TypeScript 5.2. I _love_ this feature
and, almost instantly, it gave me the idea to incorporate it into my testing to
cleanly encapsulate the process of creating test databases, mock servers and so
on and then tearing them down to avoid conflicts, contentions and runaway
resource usage.

A common mishap with testing is when one test writes to shared resources like
the file system or a database in such a way that it affects the outcome of
subsequent tests and test runs. To solve this problem, we often need to write
code that directs the side effects of a test to dedicated, temporary or
throwaway resources. For example, if we're testing code that writes to the
filesytem, we can achieve test isolation like this:

```ts title="test.ts"
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import { test, expect } from "vitest";

test("write monthly reports to disk", async () => {
	const tmpDir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "test-"));

	const report = await writeReport(tmpDir);

	expect(fs.existsSync(path.join(tmpDir, "report.csv"))).toBe(true);
});

test("read monthly reports from disk", async () => {
	const tmpDir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "test-"));
	const reportPath = path.join(tmpDir, "report.csv");

	fs.writeFileSync(reportPath, "y,q1,q2,q3,q4\n2025,10,20,30,40");

	const report = await readReports(reportPath);

	expect(report).toEqual([{ year: 2025, q: [10, 20, 30, 40] }]);
});
```

The two tests above won't interfere with each other because each will write to
a different randomly named temporary directory.

Something similar can be done to spin up test databases for each test. However,
it will be additionally useful to close connections and tear down these
databases after each test.

Let's look at how we can achieve test isolation when working with databases with
the help of the new JavaScript syntax and some useful libraries.

## Prelude

To pull off this demo, I'm going to be using the following components:

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for writing and running tests.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database.
- [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) which will be used to
  seamlessly create the PostgreSQL containers when running tests.
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as the database migration tool and ORM.

## Vitest configuration

Before we execute any tests, we need to spin up a PostgreSQL container. This
process will done in a global setup script that Vitest will run for us. We
specify this in the `vitest.config.ts` file:

```ts title="vitest.config.ts" {5}
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
	test: {
		globalSetup: ["./src/testing/setup-db.ts"],
	},
});
```

## Global setup

In our global setup script, we'll declare `setup` and `teardown` functions that
will:

1. Create the PostgreSQL container.
2. Apply all our project's migrations to the test database.
3. Store connection information for the test database in the Vitest environment.
4. Stop the container when Vitest is done.

In code, it will look something like this:

```ts title="src/testing/setup-db.ts"
import path from "node:path";
import {
	PostgreSqlContainer,
	type StartedPostgreSqlContainer,
} from "@testcontainers/postgresql";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import { migrate } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres/migrator";
import { Pool } from "pg";
import type { TestProject } from "vitest/node";

declare module "vitest" {
	// Augment this type to let TypeScript know about what we're stashing in test
	// context. Other test code will be able to using the `inject` function to
	// access these values.
	export interface ProvidedContext {
		dbURI: string;
		templateDB: string;
	}
}

let container!: StartedPostgreSqlContainer;

export async function setup(project: TestProject) {
	container = await new PostgreSqlContainer().start();

	const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: container.getConnectionUri() });

	const db = drizzle(pool);
	await migrate(db, {
		migrationsFolder: path.join(process.cwd(), "drizzle"),
	});

	await pool.end();

	project.provide("dbURI", container.getConnectionUri());
	project.provide("templateDB", container.getDatabase());
}

export async function teardown() {
	await container?.stop();
}
```

The interesting part that we've yet to see is that we won't be using the default
database in our tests. Instead, we're going to treat it as a "template" database
and each test that wants to work with a database will have a clone to mutate.

## Creating a helper function

We want each test to work with a pristine database since this will guarantee us
that tests are isolated from each other. To make it seamless, we also want don't
test authors to worry about cleaning up at the end of each test regardless of
whether or not the test passed. Here's what our helper function will look like:

```ts title="src/testing/db.ts" {26-28}
import crypto from "node:crypto";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { inject } from "vitest";

let setupPool!: Pool;

export async function createDatabaseClient() {
	const dbURI = inject("dbURI");
	const db = inject("templateDB");

	if (!setupPool) {
		setupPool = new Pool({ connectionString: dbURI });
	}

	const name = `test_${crypto.randomBytes(8).toString("hex")}`;

	await setupPool.query(`CREATE DATABASE ${name} TEMPLATE ${db}`);

	const connectionString = new URL(`/${name}`, dbURI).toString();

	const p = new Pool({ connectionString });

	return {
		db: drizzle(p),
		async [Symbol.asyncDispose]() {
			await p.end();
		},
	};
}
```

In the code above, we're creating a connection to the PostgreSQL container which
we created in our global setup script in order to clone our default (read:
template) database. Each time we clone we use a randomly generated database name
to avoid collisions with other tests. Finally, we return an object with a
Drizzle database client that tests will use and an interesting property
`[Symbol.asyncDispose]`. I'll gloss over it for now because it'll be more
apparent how it works when we get to use our helper function.

## Writing tests

Ok, now that we have everything in place, we can start writing out tests using
our newly created helper function. Here are a couple of contrived examples:

```ts title="src/example.test.ts"
import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { todosTable, usersTable } from "./db/schema";
import { createDatabaseClient } from "./testing/db";

test("create user", async () => {
	await using handle = await createDatabaseClient();

	const { db } = handle;
	const result = await db.insert(usersTable).values({
		displayName: faker.person.fullName(),
	});
	expect(result.rowCount).toEqual(1);
});

test("create 10 todos", async () => {
	await using handle = await createDatabaseClient();

	const newTodos = Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => ({
		title: faker.lorem.sentence(),
	}));

	const { db } = handle;
	const result = await db.insert(todosTable).values(newTodos);
	expect(result.rowCount).toEqual(newTodos.length);
});
```

When you run these tests with `npx vitest run` you'll likely see the tests pass:

```
 ✓ src/example.test.ts (2 tests) 71ms
   ✓ create 10 todos
   ✓ create user

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  2 passed (2)
   Start at  21:15:31
   Duration  1.96s
```

Crucially, as each test runs, a randomly named database will be spun up and torn
down.

Let's focus in on this line:

```
await using dbResources = await createDatabaseClient();
```

There are two `await` keywords here which looks confusing and now we see the new
`using` keyword. Let me show you an alternate and rough translation of this
syntax to clear things up:

```ts title="using-boilerplate.ts" "await"
test("create user", async () => {
	let handle: AsyncDisposable | undefined;
	try {
		handle = await createDatabaseClient();

		// do some stuff with the database
	} finally {
		const cleanupFunc = handle?.[Symbol.asyncDispose];
		if (cleanupFunc) {
			await cleanupFunc();
		}
	}
});
```

## Wrap up

One of my least favorite aspects of many test frameworks is how you're driven
towards declaring shared variables that are initialized and reset in
`beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks. Each tests starts to leak its setup and
teardown steps and you find yourself scrolling up and down a test file to
reconstruct what a test is doing. My primary principle with testing is that each
test should be fully self-contained and give you a complete picture of the
setup-action-assertion-teardown cycle. The result of following this principle is
that you will quickly understand and fix or modify a broken test because all you
need to parse is within the lexical scope of a `test("…", async () => { … })`
callback. Historically, this principle was often violated when it came to
setting up resources like databases and mock servers but this doesn't have to be
the case anymore. In terms of prior art, Golang's built-in `testing` package has
a `T.Cleanup` method ([docs][go-cleanup]) and the Ava test framework has a
similar `t.teardown` ([docs][ava-teardown]) helper.

Now, JavaScript and TypeScript have syntax and a runtime primitive for
describing the lifecycle of resources. We've seen how these can be used in the
context of testing but they go well beyond that and can be used in production
code.
